Purpose:
The Homework 4 folder repository holds MSDS Week #4 homework assignment files for Doing Data Science Summer 2018.

Topics:
The focus of Unit 4 is Collaboration and Versioning.  The homework assignment allows the student to work with an online repository via the RStudio environment by exploring a particular dataset, examining and plotting the dataset, as well as setting up a github tool repository to practice providing information needed for well thought out codebooks.
Sources:
In this repository, the overall approach to creating reproducible research is based on both the SMU MSDS curriculum and the principles presented by Christopher Gandrud in his text "Reproducible Research with R and RStudio." A variety of data sources will be utilized for the homework assignments and will be credited accordingly.
